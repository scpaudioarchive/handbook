The content determines which channel it should be uploaded to:

- [The main channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMAin2XEDUkMQwSaRACDeeA)
- [Internal channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtf8-Sfa3Xknpfh1oZUsIw)

Obviously, podcast recordings must go on the main channel, as well as any videos/ livestreams that should be shared with the general audience/ subscribers.

Livestreamed/ recorded meetings can be put on the internal channel **as public** unless there is a good reason for it to be private. **Do not uplaod a video as unlisted**.

To view private internal videos, sign in to the SCPFAA internal brand account.

Avoid linking material in the description! Instead, link or embed the video from the source.
