The content determines which channel it should be uploaded to:

- [The main channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMAin2XEDUkMQwSaRACDeeA)
- [Internal channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtf8-Sfa3Xknpfh1oZUsIw)

Obviously, podcast recordings must go on the main channel, as well as any videos/ livestreams that should be shared with the general audience/ subscribers.

Livestreamed/ recorded meetings can be put on the internal channel **as public** unless there is a good reason for it to be private. **Do not uplaod a video as unlisted**. 

There is **no** quality filter and videos can be embedded as necessary. If something is important enough to be put on the main channel, it can be further edited.

To view private internal videos, sign in to the SCPFAA internal brand account.

Avoid linking material in the description! Instead, link or embed the video from the source.

## We could just use Google Drive?

- Longer upload times
- Longer to process
- No automatically generated subtitles
- Worse quality
- Cannot be searched
- Cannot be viewed publically easily

## Internal channel policy

- Respond to comments from the main SCPFAA channel
- Do **not** comment, subscribe to channels or watch videos
- Do not mark the content as "for kids"

Please let someone know if you come across inappropriate usage of the channel.
