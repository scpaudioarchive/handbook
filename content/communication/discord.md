Staff have access to the `THAUMIEL` category. This is not open to the public and should be used when communicating internally.

- Important accouncements: `#staff-chat`, mention, pin
- General chatter: `#staff-chat`
- Off-topic: `#other-chat`
- On-topic channels can be created as needed under the `THAUMIEL` category

Quick meetings/ Discord-related meetings can use the `staff-vc`.

## Stages

Stages can be useful as a "bridge" between internal meetings and members (eg. Zoom meeting for members + open Discord stage).

Do **not** use stages if:

- You need to screen share
- You need video (cameras) on
- Anyone in the Discord server should be able to freely unmute themselves

## Recording meetings

Discord does not offer a way to record voice/ stage channels, however, there is an audio recording bot called [Craig](https://craig.chat/home/) that can be used. There is no way we're aware of to also capture go live streams and videos through Discord.

OBS can be used to record your screen/ window and desktop audio. Keep in mind that it will record your entire screen/ Discord window, so disable capturing mouse and avoid opening text channels with sensitive information, as well as desktop audio (turn Do Not Disturb on). This can then be uploaded to YouTube.

## Sharing desktop audio as well as screen

**TODO:** Embed a YT Video detailing instructions
