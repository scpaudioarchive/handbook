Zoom is used when there limitations on Discord that cannot be overcome (high quality screensharing with audio on Linux, screensharing on iPad, finer meeting security settings, etc.).

We currently have one free account set up (free due to financial constraints). Members can join with their personal zoom accounts.

## Tips

- Keep the meeting link in one place (Google Calendar) instead of Docs, as it can change. If it was changed around the start of the meeting, then it is ok to have it there temporarily.
- Use a meeting password and keep the waiting room setting enabled.
- The meeting password is embedded into the join link be default. As such, be careful where you share it.
- It is recommended to share the meeting zoom link in the Google Calendar description, not in Docs.
  - Link to the Docs, or, **even better**, provide the **Document Title**.
- In [zoom settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting), enable the following settings:
  - Mute all participants when they join a meeting
  - Always show meeting control toolbar
  - Non-verbal feedback
  - Breakout room
  - Closed captioning
  - Save Captions
  - Focus Mode

## Recording/ Livestreaming Meetings

The current process is recording, to:

- Locally record (built in to Zoom)
- Upload to YouTube (SCPFAA internal) as **public/ private**
  - If private, prefix the video title as such

Livestreaming can be done using OBS.

## Free account limitations

- The number of total participants
- The meeting time if there are more than 2 participants (40 min.)
  - A workaround is to simply use a recurring meeting and start it again
  - Meeting recording can be concatenated using `ffmpeg` and uploaded to YouTube
