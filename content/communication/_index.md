title: Communication
---

Chatting via [Discord](discord) is preferred as a starting point, and is preferred whenever possible. Synchronous audio/ video meetings can also be utilized when necessary. Again, [Discord](discord) and/ or [Zoom](zoom) can be used.

## Important communication

Important communication should be announced in at least 2 places: the relevant Discord channel, over email lists, during a meeting, or directly, ideally on the same day. A "single source of truth" e.g. link to the handbook/ internal site/ site/ Google Doc should be attached.

## Away

Life happens. If you need to be away for an extended period of time, please let the relevant channel know, mentioning people as relevant. Also, consider updating your nickname in Discord to reflect that (ex.: `earne - Away until date`).
