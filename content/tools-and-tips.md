## Google Drive

Due to financial reasons, we currently are not part of a Google workspace. This may change in the future, though. For now, we work off of personal Google accounts. If you don't have one, or you want a separate name/ identity to be associated, please create one.

With regards to storage, if you are concerned about storage quotas, please have me create/ upload the file under the primary account so it won't count against your quota. We will investigate a selfhosted Nextcloud instance for large files that are not documents/ spreadsheets/ presentations etc.

- Avoid linking directly to Google Drive/ Apps
  - Consdier including the name of the file so members can search for it in Google Drive. If you link directly to the URL, unadded people can request access.
- Keep it organized
