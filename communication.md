# Communications

Async/ synchronous chatting via Discord is preferred as a starting point, and is preferred whenever possible. If you are away for an extended period of time, please edit your nickname in the server to reflect that, and write about it in the staff channel if possible.

Quick audio/ video meetings can also be utilized when necessary on Discord. For longer, planned events (whether closed or public) should utilize Zoom.
