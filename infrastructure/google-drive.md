# Google Drive (legacy/ outdated page)

Due to financial reasons, we currently are not part of a Google workspace. ~~This may change in the future, though.~~

We now are trialing utilization of a Cryptpad instance for collaboration, if Google Drive-specific features are not needed.

Sharing through Google to all can be done via using the mailing list.

For now, if needed, we work off of personal Google accounts. If you don't have one, or you want a separate name/ identity to be associated, please create one.

With regards to storage, if you are concerned about storage quotas, please have me create/ upload the file under the primary account so it won't count against your quota.

~~We will investigate a selfhosted Nextcloud instance for large files that are not documents/ spreadsheets/ presentations etc.~~

- Avoid linking directly to Google Drive/ Apps
  - Consdier including the name of the file so members can search for it in Google Drive. If you link directly to the URL, unadded people can request access.
- Keep it organized
