# Zoom

I (the host) currently use my personal Zoom account, but am considering upgrading to the cheapest paid account (which is still quite expensive). Members can join with their personal zoom accounts.

## Tips

- Keep the meeting link in one place (the event page *instead* of docs, as it can change. If it was changed suddenly around the start of the meeting, then it is ok to have it there temporarily.
- Keep the event page up to date with links to (if used):
  - Meeting link
  - Relevant Cryptpad docs/ materials
  - Video recording
- Unless it is a public meeting, use a meeting password and keep the waiting room setting enabled.
- The meeting password is embedded into the join link be default. As such, be careful where you share it.

## Checklist

### Account setup

In [zoom settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting) and settings in app, enable the following settings:

- Mute all participants when they join a meeting
- Always show meeting control toolbar
- Non-verbal feedback
- Breakout room
- Poll (if needed)
- Closed captioning
- Save Captions
- Focus Mode

### Meeting

- Soundcheck users
- If needed:
  - Enable share screen/ chat settings
  - Grant co-hosts
  - Hide profile photos
  - Record/ Start live-stream

## Public meetings

- If waiting room is enabled, send message of approx. when starting
- If needed, prevent users from unmuting/ starting video
- Soundcheck participants in breakout room/ main session
- Grant co-hosts access
- Start recording/ live-stream

## Recording/ Livestreaming Meetings (outdated?)

- Locally record (built in to Zoom)
- Cloud record (with a premium account)
- Upload to YouTube (SCPFAA internal) as **public/ private**
  - If private, prefix the video title as such

Livestreaming can be done using OBS/ Zoom.

## Free account limitations

- The number of total participants
- The meeting time if there are more than 2 participants (40 min.)
  - A workaround is to simply use a recurring meeting and start it again
  - Meeting recording can be concatenated using `ffmpeg` and uploaded to YouTube
